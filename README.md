# Project Motive:
  As a part Of IBM Nalaiya Thiran program, we have chosen this project University Admission Eligibility Predictor
  The main motive of this machine learning project is to help the students who wish to persue their higher studies in abroad universitiies.
  We help them by analysing their chances of admission based on the previous admission record history and tell them whether they have a chance of getting admission or not.
  
  #Model:
    We use the Random Forest Regressor algorithm to build the model and testing is being done.
    The independent variables we have chosen are
      1. GRE Score
      2. TOFEL Score
      3. University Rating
      4. SOP value
      5. LOR value
      6. CGPA
      7. Whether Research Done or Not
      
 # Application Building: 
    We have build a html form page to get the response from the user
    Based on the user response the model predicts the possibility and redirects to the corresponding page
    we have used Flask to build the backend side
    The ML model is converted into pickle object file and used in the program
    
  #Thank You.
